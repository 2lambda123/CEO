Notebooks:
==========

Ipython notebooks are a convenient way to interact with the **CEO** library.
Once you have installed **CEO**, add **CEO** `python` directory to ``PYTHONPATH`` and you should be able to import **CEO** in your python applications with ``from ceo import ceo``.
Links to a few  **CEO** ipython notebooks are given below.

Note that the notebooks mode of ipython is started with ``ipython notebook``.
If you are working remotely on a GPU server, you can start an ipython notebook server on the GPU host with: ``ipython notebook --no-browser --port=7000``.
Then locally you open a ssh tunnel with ``ssh -N -f -L localhost:5555:localhost:7000 username@gpu_server_address`` and you point your favorite browser to ``localhost:5555``
